# BluSEO
The SEO Plugin for Bludit

With the BluSEO plugin you can control which pages Google shows in its search results and which pages it doesn't show. By default, it will tell search engines to index all of your pages, and to only show the first pages in the search results. Category and tag archives are also exluded from search engines index.
